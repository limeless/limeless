### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I don't use Github as a place share my code, I use it to follow up open-source projects.
A self-taught full-stack engineer, been positions on UI/UX, PG, RD, PM, DevOps.
Done tons of work but not allows me to share on internet because confidentiality agreement.

Recently decided to resign my job and start following what I really love. so you probably will see me on here more often.

By the way I use Arch.
