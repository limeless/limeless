A self-taught full-stack engineer, been positions on UI/UX, PG, RD, PM, DevOps.
  
I don't use Github as a place share my code, I use it to follow up open-source projects.

Decided to resign my job after burn out and start following what I really love. Hence, you probably will see me around more often.
